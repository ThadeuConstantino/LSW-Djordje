Interview

LSW Documentation:
First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this selection process
and hope to meet the company's expectations.
For this project, I decided to use different techniques to show different skills. In order to
organize the character's data and the enemies I used Scriptable Objects, which facilitates
the organization and is a technique widely used in the games industry.
For the “GameOver” popup I used as a prefab in the Resources folder, just to show that I am
experienced with loading the prefab from the external folder of the project. This technique is
very interesting because it allows us to have from any scene the same prefab.
Referring to the Gameplay and idea, I assumed that a warrior is trying to leave the land of
monsters but for that he must face the “Boss” who holds him in the underworld.
About the illustrations of the game I downloaded some of them from a free website, but
some objects as well as the initial screen of the game were made by me using Adobe
software (Animate CC).
The whole game code was programmed by me, both front and back end.
The game contains Save Load using asset ES3 and writing in file.txt as this asset is very
used in the market and I have vast experience using it.
For me, it was a great experience making this game and in my opinion it is very good
considering the short development time. I focused on making a simple but complete game
with a start, middle and end with a structure that enables easily including new levels.
As a game lover I had a lot of fun making it and hope you have fun too!
